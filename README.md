Data-driven Platform for disrupting the Nigerian Music Industry

Coupled with the creation of a virtual avatar that "lives the life" of an upcoming Nigerian music artist all the way up to them becoming an internet sensation and superstar - all through the power of data and technology !

"Living the Life" will include everything from fanbase interaction, artistic music composition, publishing and release, to touring and other activities. Essentially a recreation of the lifecycle a typical Nigerian music artist follows. 

Included in this vision is to expand the tech beyond to music to other mediums - Nigerian movies (i.e. take on Nollywood), Books, Games, etc
